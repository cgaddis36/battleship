Thoughts:

So, the player gives all 3 coordinates for a ship at once.  We might want to
shovel them in an array.  The tests pass now if a player enters duplicate values
so we need to address that.  We could iterate over that array to place cells
after that.

For the computer selected ship placement, we should keep in mind what Aurora
said about the random number generator and use that in a separate method.
So we need to find one that accepts the limits of our board values.

Might be nice to make another instance variable @why_failed = "doubles" or
"chosen cells not on board". and have it display with our invalid coordinate
message to give our players a clue .

Runner file should just include mostly methods called on classes. very little
code.

need new class called turn?
